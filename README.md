# KANGARU-ETL

Set up and run custom ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tasks.
Kargaru-ETL is a user-friendly, cross-platform Electron application designed to utilize the RxJS-ETL library. RxJS-ETL is a modular platform built with RxJS observables that allow developers to create stream-based ETL pipelines. The platform offers additional capabilities such as buffering, bulk insertions, notifications upon task completion, job scheduling, and the establishment of task dependencies. Those who wish for or need a more visual and guided experience using RxJS-ETL can run Kangaru-ETL to import and export files, connect to databases, write transformation scripts, and set up a queue of scheduled ETL jobs.
